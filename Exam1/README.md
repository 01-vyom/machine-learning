# Homework-1
 
- 6 questions on basics of linear regression, regressive (multi-)class classification tasks, and convex optimization problems.

- The first question was to solve a least-sqaures problem, for a given objective function. I used the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) to formulate and find the solution to the said problem.
